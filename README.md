# facblueview

In-browser preview of Factorio 0.15 blueprints.

String goes in, image comes out.

## Disclaimers

* Yes it's full of nasty; contributions encouraged!
* Yes this includes a dump of Factorio graphics; I believe this is consistent with the intent of the [Factorio Terms of Service](https://www.factorio.com/terms-of-service) and [Press page](https://www.factorio.com/press-and-youtube) but if you're from Wube and feel differently, please let me know!
* This is a quick hacky project to play with JS and enable easy previewing; the image links may break / move / not be permanent / not be correct, though I'll do my best!
